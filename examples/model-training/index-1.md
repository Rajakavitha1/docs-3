TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning software library, TensorFlow is used to train neural networks. Expressed in the form of stateful dataflow graphs, each node in the graph represents the operations performed by neural networks on multi-dimensional arrays. These multi-dimensional arrays are commonly known as “tensors,” hence the name TensorFlow. In this example, we will be training a MNIST model.

## Training TensorFlow models Locally

This section is from [TensorFlow 2 quickstart for beginners](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/quickstart/beginner.ipynb)

### TensorFlow 2 quickstart for beginners

This short introduction uses [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview) to:

1. Load a prebuilt dataset.
2. Build a neural network machine learning model that classifies images.
3. Train this neural network.
4. Evaluate the accuracy of the model.

### Set up TensorFlow

Import TensorFlow into your program to check whether it is installed

```
import tensorflow as tf
import os
print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
```

```bash
%%bash
mkdir /inputs
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/mnist.npz -O /inputs/mnist.npz
```

```python
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist

CWD = '' if os.getcwd() == '/' else os.getcwd()
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data('/inputs/mnist.npz')
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0
```

### Build a machine-learning model

Build a `tf.keras.Sequential` model by stacking layers.

```python
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
```

For each example, the model returns a vector of [logits](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#logits) or [log-odds](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#log-odds) scores, one for each class.

```python
predictions = model(x_train[:1]).numpy()
predictions
```

The `tf.nn.softmax` function converts these logits to _probabilities_ for each class:

```python
tf.nn.softmax(predictions).numpy()
```

Note: It is possible to bake the `tf.nn.softmax` function into the activation function for the last layer of the network. While this can make the model output more directly interpretable, this approach is discouraged as it's impossible to provide an exact and numerically stable loss calculation for all models when using a softmax output.

Define a loss function for training using `losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy`, which takes a vector of logits and a `True` index and returns a scalar loss for each example.

```python
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
```

This loss is equal to the negative log probability of the true class: The loss is zero if the model is sure of the correct class.

This untrained model gives probabilities close to random (1/10 for each class), so the initial loss should be close to `-tf.math.log(1/10) ~= 2.3`.

```python
loss_fn(y_train[:1], predictions).numpy()
```

Before you start training, configure and compile the model using Keras `Model.compile`. Set the [`optimizer`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api\_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers) class to `adam`, set the `loss` to the `loss_fn` function you defined earlier, and specify a metric to be evaluated for the model by setting the `metrics` parameter to `accuracy`.

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=loss_fn,
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Train and evaluate your model

Use the `Model.fit` method to adjust your model parameters and minimize the loss:

```python
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)
```

The `Model.evaluate` method checks the models performance, usually on a "[Validation-set](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#validation-set)" or "[Test-set](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#test-set)".

```python
model.evaluate(x_test,  y_test, verbose=2)
```

The image classifier is now trained to \~98% accuracy on this dataset. To learn more, read the [TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/).

If you want your model to return a probability, you can wrap the trained model, and attach the softmax to it:

```python
probability_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  model,
  tf.keras.layers.Softmax()
])
```

```python
probability_model(x_test[:5])
```

```bash
%%bash
mkdir /outputs
```

the following method can be used to save the model as a checkpoint

```python
model.save_weights('/outputs/checkpoints/my_checkpoint')
```

```bash
%%bash
ls /outputs/
```

### Converting the notebook into a Python script

You can use a tool like `nbconvert` to convert your Python notebook into a script.

After that, you can create a gist of the training script at gist.github.com copy the raw link of the gist

```bash
%%bash
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/js-ts/0ce4d671ced642fbe807e65f5186ae87/raw/7f28cc497cc1c509661a33b144c0683b8fc97f41/train.py
```

Testing whether the script works

```bash
%%bash
python train.py
```

## Running on bacalhau

```python
!curl -sL https://get.bacalhau.org/install.sh | bash
```

The dataset and the script are mounted to the TensorFlow container using an URL we then run the script inside the container

```bash
%%bash --out job_id
bacalhau docker run \
--wait \
--id-only \
-w /inputs  \
-i https://gist.githubusercontent.com/js-ts/e7d32c7d19ffde7811c683d4fcb1a219/raw/ff44ac5b157d231f464f4d43ce0e05bccb4c1d7b/train.py \
-i https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/mnist.npz \
tensorflow/tensorflow \
-- python train.py
```

Structure of the command:

* `-i https://gist.githubusercontent.com/js-ts/e7d32c7d19ffde7811c683d4fcb1a219/raw/ff44ac5b157d231f464f4d43ce0e05bccb4c1d7b/train.py`: mount the training script
* `-i https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/mnist.npz`: mount the dataset
* `tensorflow/tensorflow`: specify the Docker image
* `python train.py`: execute the script

By default whatever URL you mount using the -i flag gets mounted at the path /inputs so we choose that as our input directory `-w /inputs`

```bash
%%bash
bacalhau list --id-filter ${JOB_ID}
```

Where it says `Completed`, that means the job is done, and we can get the results.

To find out more information about your job, run the following command:

```bash
%%bash
bacalhau describe ${JOB_ID}
```

```bash
%%bash
rm -rf results && mkdir -p results
bacalhau get $JOB_ID --output-dir results
```

```bash
%%bash
ls results/
```

```bash
%%bash
cat results/stdout
```

```bash
%%bash
ls results/outputs/
```
